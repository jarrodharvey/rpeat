RecordPoint is/was a Digital Records Management System.

To gain an understanding of what a Digital Records Management System is, please read the standard "ISO 16175-2:2011: Information and Documentation - Principles and functional requirements for records in electronic office environments - Part 2: Guidelines and functional requirements for digital records management systems", published by the International Organisation for Standardisation.

RecordPoint allows for the export of records and their metadata. The RPEAT software has repackaged this export into a form suitable for Transfer into Archivematica.

Each record in RecordPoint has one or more binaries. Each binary is a different version of the record. Only the latest version of each record has been included in the transfer package.

RecordPoint can manage records that originated from a number of systems. To see the system that each record originated from, refer to the metadata element 'Record Source System'.

Other important metadata is specified below. This list is not comprehensive and the RPEAT user may have chosen not to retain these elements.

Record Number: A unique identifier applied to each record

Record Site Name/Record Web Name/Record List Name: Hierarchical information relating to SharePoint. Records are arranged by Site/Web/List.
