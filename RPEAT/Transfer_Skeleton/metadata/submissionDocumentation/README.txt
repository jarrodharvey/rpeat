This Submission Information Package was generated using an application called RPEAT (RecordPoint Export to Archivematica Transfer), developed by Jarrod Harvey, Records Analyst at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, in 2019.


RPEAT uses the open-source statistical programming language R to convert packages exported from the digital records management system RecordPoint to a format that the open archival information system Archivematica can use to convert to a SIP. 


If the RPEAT user wishes, RPEAT can also generate Dublin Core metadata.


For reference, the Submission Documentation contains the following:


1. A text file, 'Stack_Info.txt' that contains system-generated information information about the environment in which RPEAT was run and the R session.

2. The text file 'RecordPoint_Primer.txt' that contains information about RecordPoint to understand the export in context. Authored by Jarrod Harvey.

3. The text file "Dublin_Core_Metadata.txt" which explains the conventions used in Dublin Core metadata.

4. This README.
